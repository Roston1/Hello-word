My name is Avornyo charles, a  graduate student of AIMS
I am always optimistic about life and I believe I will be great.
I do not believe in failure.
I just lost my grandmother, my only human source of happiness.
She really does loves me so much.
She believes in me as well
Eventhough she is not arround now I believe I will meet her in Heaven.
I love you sweetie.
